Introduction
------------
POInter is an open-source package for intermolecular force field parameter optimization. 
It has primarily been designed to optimize parameters for the MASTIFF force field, which 
uses a Slater-type functional form to describe short-range effects. In addition, 
POInter can be used to optimize intermolecular potentialss whose short-range effects are 
described by one of the following functional forms:

* Lennard-Jones 12-6 Potentials
* Born-Mayer Potentials
* Stone/Misquitta ($\exp(-\alpha r - \rho)$)

POInter can be called directly from the command line, or can be executed from within a Python script.

POInter is fairly straightforward to use
